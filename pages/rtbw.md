# tl;dr

I can be wrong. You can point it out and/or I can correct it. 


You can't blame me for being wrong. 


It is unfortunate when I go wrong but, as a human, there is nothing I can do to not be wrong.
At this time in my life, I am having a hard time accepting that having no wrongs cannot be possible.


While I am the author, and the posts are my creation no matter what. But, I am the not the author of whatever happens to you after reading my creations. 

If something good turns up, good for you. Let me know and I will be happy. 

If something bad happens, that's sad. Let me know too, I will help but you can't blame me for that.
