Suryarao Bethapudi, 22/M

220 lb, 6'1"

B+

## Why is there a "Shining" in my name?

My firstname is Suryarao, and people (mostly everyone) calls me Surya _I prefer that way, if you call me Suryarao, I would just assume that I pissed you off_.
Surya, in my mother tongue _(Telugu)_, for that matter, in _Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, (or even Malayalam)_ means the Sun. And, what does Sun do?
It shines. 

_BING BING BING_

First documented use of this name dates back to when I was creating a Facebook account in my 8th grade. _Yeah, I know, that was early_. And, my wonderful sister suggested to have "Shining" with my name on FB. 
And from then, it is stuck with my name.

## What do I do?

I do anything that interests me. My interests are pretty narrow. I get bored very fast. And, when I get bored, I do stuff. 
This website is of the _stuff_ I do.

I am a graduate student studying astronomy.

## Five words that describe me

- Heart-thinker _(I can make up words)_
- Inqusitive
- _somewhat_ Kantianism
- Food
- - Shawarma
- - Pepperoini pizza with Chicken toppings
- - Watermelon
- Surya _(Haha, I know this is cheating)_

##### If you look that feature pic closely, you will find a person gazing the night sky.
That is not me. I will have to take a pic like that before I put one there. 

But, I have it on my TODO list.
