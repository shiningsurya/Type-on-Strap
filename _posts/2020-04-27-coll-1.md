Collective operations are core to any distributed performance oriented system. 


All the elements in such a distributed system participate together, hence the name collective operations. 
Distributed system is loosely used here so take it with a pinch of salt. What I mean by elements are the individual nodes. 


I am not going to perform any scientific profiling of each of the algorithms. I am lazy. 


Interested and not so lazy folks check this paper:


[Optimization of Collective Communication Operations in MPICH](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~thakur/papers/ijhpca-coll.pdf)


_There will be a part two where I cover reduce-scatter and reduce_.


#### manim

I used  [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) package to generate the vidoes. 


It is an amazing software.

##  Broadcast 

When one node has all the data and all the nodes should have all the data.

### Binomial tree

To be honest, this should be called "binary tree".

### van Geijn's algorithm

Kind of cool. Still amazes me. 


If you have a super large chunk of data, sending the super large chunk to each and every node is going to cost a lot of bandwidth. Instead, break it into smaller chunks and give a chunk to each and every node. Now, tell all those nodes (including ourselves) to share among each other.

## AllGather

When each of the nodes has some data and all the nodes should have all the data.


### Bruck's algorithm

The good ol' distance doubling trick applied here.


All data transactions happen in one direction.

### Recursive doubling

Pairwise swapping. Double the distance each step.

### Ring

Nearest neighbour.
