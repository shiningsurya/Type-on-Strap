# Declaration of resolve

I, Suryarao Bethapudi, on 29th of September 2018, swear to myself, that from now on, in every week, I will work on one problem selected from the Putnam archive. 

I will not plagarize the solution (although the solution is available  in the archive).

## Motivation
I didn't know about the Putnam prize until I was in fourth year (of my undergrad) doing graduate applications when I was checking out Lorenzo Sadun's Yang Mills mass gap talk.

I decided to be _better late than never_. 

Years from now, after I become a professor (hopefully), I would like to start something similar in Indian colleges and universities.

## Edge cases

The rule is simple. One week is one problem.

I do one problem early, I get the next problem ready and start on it right away.

I can't do a problem in a week, I now have to do two problems. 

This is to teach me discipline which I lack. Hehe!

## Metric

So, I actually keep track of my progress, I have three metrics:

|-----------------|---------------|
| Metric          |  Score             |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Total Questions Done | 1  |
| Worked satisfactorily | 1 | 
| Should have worked harder | 0 |
|-----------------|---------------|
