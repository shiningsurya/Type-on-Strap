<h1 id="this-too-shall-pass">This Too Shall Pass</h1>

<p>Sometime in  my second (or third) year of my undergrad, when there was a lot of shit happening, I came across this adage. 
I don’t know where exactly I read this (maybe in a manga chapter or in Translator Notes of one), but, it kind of stuck to me. 
Later on, when my sixth semester of my undergrad started, I connected to it on a super emo level, which I will dwell on, in a latter post. 
<em>=D I have super strong reason to wait for the right reason to make a post about that.</em></p>

<p>No piece of work about <strong>This Too Shall Pass</strong> would be incomplete without mentioning the fabled tale. 
Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_too_shall_pass">Wikipedia</a>. Since, that wiki page is a <strong>wiki</strong> page. I decided to <em>code</em> it up:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">while</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">Death</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">BadTime</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">GoodTime</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’ve read the tale in the wiki page, you would know how the same thing which can make someone happy when sad can also make someone sad when happy. I am not surprised when people whom I have told about this, said it is a dangerous <em>side effect</em>. 
This <em>side effect</em> of never really bothered me. Drink the water from the glass if you’re thristy. If it is empty, fill it up. If it is  filled to the brim, stop filling it more. You can’t anyway stop time. So, if you’re in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">GoodTime</code> you might as well enjoy it.</p>

<p>One another catch I have noticed about this proverb is to <strong>NOT</strong> just sit, doing nothing, during <code class="highlighter-rouge">BadTime</code>. I understand there will always be situations when you can do nothing, but, until that <em>helpless</em> situation arrives, <em>don’t give up</em>… (bgm: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKSRyLdjsPA">Sia-The Greatest</a> )</p>

<p>Since I have known this quote for a long time, I am quite capable of attaching a <em>Cherishing</em> and <em>Gratitutous</em> attitude to it, but only selectively for I am a mere human.</p>

<p>To account for the case when I am in <code class="highlighter-rouge">BadTime</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">GoodTime</code>, there’s that last <code class="highlighter-rouge">else</code> case below wherein I want to just enjoy life as it unfolds.</p>

<p>Now, I present to you, my <strong>Life Code</strong> based in Python.</p>

<p><em>I made a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Surya</code> object</em></p>
