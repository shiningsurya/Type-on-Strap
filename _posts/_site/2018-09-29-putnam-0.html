<p>I, Suryarao Bethapudi, on 29th of September 2018, swear to myself, that from now on, in every week, I will work on one problem selected from the Putnam archive.</p>

<p>I will not plagarize the solution (although the solution is available  in the archive).</p>

<p>I didn’t know about the Putnam prize until I was in fourth year (of my undergrad) doing graduate applications when I was checking out Lorenzo Sadun’s Yang Mills mass gap talk.</p>

<p>I decided to be <em>better late than never</em>.</p>

<p>Years from now, after I become a professor (hopefully), I would like to start something similar in Indian colleges and universities.</p>

<h2 id="edge-cases">Edge cases</h2>

<p>The rule is simple. One week is one problem.</p>

<p>I do one problem early, I get the next problem ready and start on it right away.</p>

<p>I can’t do a problem in a week, I now have to do two problems.</p>

<p>This is to teach me discipline which I lack. Hehe!</p>
