I found a really nice song after some time. 
_So much so that I decided to write this post._

The movie is a Telugu remake of a Tamil movie involving romance and spearation and stuff. I haven't watched at the time of writing. 


# Lyrics 

Yedhare-edhurina yetu veluthundho adigana
_I never asked where any path would take me_
Emi thochani parugai pravahisthu pothuna
_Heedlessly running on my way_
Emi chusthu unna ne vethikana yedhaina
_I am looking at all the things but I am not searching for anything_
Oorikine chuttu yevevo kanipisthu unna
_Simply watching everything I can see_


Kadha lani ho shilane aina
_I became a sculpture which doesn't move_
Thrutilo karige kalane aina
_I became a fleeting dream_
Emi theda udhata
Nuvevarantu adigithe nannevaraina
_If I were asked what's unique about me_


Illage kadadhaka
_Until the very end_
Ho prashnai untan antunna
_I will just be that question_
Yedho oka badhulai
Nanu cherapoddhani kalan aduguthu unna
_I pray to Time that I won't be wiped away just like a change_


Naa venta padi nuvvu entha ontari vana vaddhu
Annodhu dhayunchi yavaru
_I pray that no one asks if I am lonely after they look at my life_
Inkoni janmalaki saripadu
Aneka sruthulni itharalu yeragaru
_Bestown upon me many more "SaReGaMa" enough to last a few more lifetimes_


Naa oopirini innaluga
_All my breaths up until now_
Thana vennati nadipina
_Have followed him/her_
Cheyutha yavaridhi
_Who is doing it?_
Na yadha layanu kusalamu adigina
_Who asked my echo for happiness_
Gusa gusa kabhurula
_which have been whispering_
Guma guma levarivi
_And, who does this sweet fragnance belong to?_


Udhayam kagane thazaga puduthu unta
_I am reborn afresh every morning_
Kaalam ipude nanu kanadha
_As if Time gave birth to me_
Anaganaga antu ne unta
_I always start -- "Once upon a time"_
Yepudu poorthavane avaka
_Never do I complete_
Thundi leni kadha nenuga
_I am a story but with no will_


Gali watam laga aage alavate leka
_I am like the gale winds which don't stop anywhere_
Kaalu nilavadhu ye chota nilakadaga
_My legs don't stand still anywhere_
Ye chirunama leka ye badhulu podhani lekha
_Without an address or hope of reply_
Yedhuku vestundho keka mounamga
_Why do I silently scream?_


Lolu yekantham na chuttu allina lokam
_The world which sprinkled solitude all around me_
Naake sontham antunna vinaara
_Says I am owner_
Nenu na needa iddarame chal antunna
_I am content with myself and my shadow_
Raku dadhu inke evaraina
_And I don't want anyone else_

Amma vodilo monna
_I had been in my mother's lap_
Andhani aashalatho ninna
_And then with unreachable dreams_
Yentho ooristhu undhi
_Both of which tempt me a lot_
Jaabili entha dhoorana unna
_No matter how far the moon is_
Vennelega chathane unna
_Moonlight has always been with me_
Antu ooyalaopindhi jolali
_Which sings me a lullaby_

Thaane naane naanine
