Roses may very well be the king of all flowers, but even they turn to Sunflowers to show them the Sun when the day gets going.


There was a Monet's Sunflower impression oil on canvas in my home when I was growing up. I don't know what happened to it when we moved places.. That was the first time I remember seeing a sunflower or atleast I remember so. I fell in love with it. I fell in love with Monet's painting but moreso, with the Sunflower. 


I did a bit of googling and searched for symbolism in Sunflowers:


[Pro flowers](https://www.proflowers.com/blog/history-and-meaning-of-sunflowers) say sunflowers symbolize adoration, loyalty and longevity, and that they are happy flowers.


> While googling I came across a Greek myth about how love in vain made Sunflower what it is. But, I didn't find any coroborrating evidence for in the [myth's wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clytie_(Oceanid)) page, so I don't know how much truth is there.


Van Gogh had made many Sunflower paintings too. [Sunflower series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflowers_(Van_Gogh_series)), 
the wikipedia article has a section named _Sunflowers, friendship and gratitude_. His love for Sunflower or maybe the color yellow is evident in his letter (also mentioned in the wikipedia article).


And then there is the [Monet's Sunflower](https://www.claude-monet.com/sunflowers.jsp). 


One side-dream I have is to grow sunflowers on a field. Or, maybe in a garden or a nursery. And I wouldn't want to grow just one or three.


This post is incomplete without a sunflower pic so...
