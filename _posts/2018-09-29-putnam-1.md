### Problem:

##### 1996 Putnam | A2

Let $$C_1$$ and $$C_2$$ be circles whose centers are 10 units apart, and whose radii are 1 and 3. Find, with proof, the locus of all points $$M$$ for which there exists points $$X$$ on $$C_1$$ and $$Y$$ on $$C_2$$ such that $$M$$ is the midpoint of the line segment $$XY$$.
