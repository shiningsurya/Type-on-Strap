The actress seems to have the power to create happiness. She changes subjects going from super sad to happy in an instant.


The context of the conversation never stays angry for any party for long durations

##### The symbolism of the train.


The symbolism of the train plays a pivotal role in the story's development. On one hand we have the actresses' missing of the train in the station Ratlam, and on the other hand we have her feeling of missing train as a premonition of a bad decision.
