_at the time of writing, I only could identify, characterize one demon_

It is that time when I sit with my laptop and rant about things. 
I am going to rant about myself, in particular, one specific trait about myself that is bothering me a lot. 

## Numero uno

I get a lot of ideas. Ideas I find very interesting. Ideas, which I believe, once seen until completion will be a fruitful exercise. 
All of this is nice and good but my demon doesn't let me complete it. It just stays as an idea at the end. 

This sucks big time.

I want to be able to follow through, see until the completion all the ideas I get. No matter how small they are. I attribute this inability to  to my _giving up_ attitude.

I want to be able to not give up no easily.
