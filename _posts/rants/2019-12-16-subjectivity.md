I understand I have **this too shall pass** tattooed but happiness is still something I haven't de-sensitized myself completely yet.

Future Surya, or some reader. If that one thing which you thought would make you happy, or lack of that thing which made you sad despite everything else; when you do get it, are you sure that would make you happy?

Now, when I am writing this, I yearned, cried for that one thing for almost two years now. And, I have it and I don't feel that I am that happy as I thought I would be.

This puts a new perspective on things. Kind of makes it happy-sad as well.
