I am at that point in my life where I believe no amount of applied physical force can bring about a lasting change in any human. Only way , I think now, is by making them realize on their own what is to be understood. 

If what makes the pen mightier than a sword is the words it writes, then the powerful the words, stronger the pen. And if mere words can make the pen win against a sword, those same words are capable of much more feats.

It is this same thought with which, I am bringing out a list of proverbs. Neeti is a telugu word often associated with Chanakya neeti which means knowledge. This knowledge isn't like physics or math. I wouldn't want to say something as bold as -- "guidelines of living lives."
At the moment, I can't exactly define this class of knowledge.

(I will make a post about Chakanya neeti some time soon.)

Proverbs are selected from *A handbook of proverbs* published in 1855 selecting those who survived the test of time. [Link](https://archive.org/details/ahandbookprover01raygoog/)

Some of the proverbs are adjusted to suite the current century outlooks. All proverbs containing masculine subject have been stripped of their gender.
