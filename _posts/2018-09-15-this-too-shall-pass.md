# This Too Shall Pass

Sometime in  my second (or third) year of my undergrad, when there was a lot of shit happening, I came across this adage. 
I don't know where exactly I read this (maybe in a manga chapter or in Translator Notes of one), but, it kind of stuck to me. 
Later on, when my sixth semester of my undergrad started, I connected to it on a super emo level, which I will dwell on, in a latter post. 
_=D I have super strong reason to wait for the right reason to make a post about that._


No piece of work about **This Too Shall Pass** would be incomplete without mentioning the fabled tale. 
Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_too_shall_pass). Since, that wiki page is a **wiki** page. I decided to _code_ it up:

{% highlight python %}
while not Death:
    if BadTime:
        pass
    elif GoodTime:
        pass
{% endhighlight %}

If you've read the tale in the wiki page, you would know how the same thing which can make someone happy when sad can also make someone sad when happy. I am not surprised when people whom I have told about this, said it is a dangerous _side effect_. 
This _side effect_ of never really bothered me. Drink the water from the glass if you're thristy. If it is empty, fill it up. If it is  filled to the brim, stop filling it more. You can't anyway stop time. So, if you're in a ``GoodTime`` you might as well enjoy it. 

One another catch I have noticed about this proverb is to **NOT** just sit, doing nothing, during ``BadTime``. I understand there will always be situations when you can do nothing, but, until that _helpless_ situation arrives, _don't give up_... (bgm: [Sia-The Greatest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKSRyLdjsPA) )

Since I have known this quote for a long time, I am quite capable of attaching a _Cherishing_ and _Gratitutous_ attitude to it, but only selectively for I am a mere human. 

To account for the case when I am in ``BadTime`` and ``GoodTime``, there's that last ``else`` case below wherein I want to just enjoy life as it unfolds. 

Now, I present to you, my **Life Code** based in Python.

_I made a ``Surya`` object_
{% highlight python %}
while Surya.isAlive():
    if Surya.inBadTime():
        while Surya.canDo():
            Surya.DontGiveUp()
        pass
    elif Surya.inGoodTime():
        Surya.Cherish()
        Surya.Gratitude()
        pass
    else:
        Surya.EnjoyLife()
		pass
{% endhighlight %}
