## Astronomical Photo of the Day 

Everyone loves APOD. See [this](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200507.html).

## What started this?

I saw an analemma of Moon in one of the reddit post but then one fellow redditor said that its fake and gave an explanation which seemed sophisticated and I didn't bother much. Few days later (as it always is the case), the same image found its way in my facebook newsfeed, so I sort of became determined in answering that.

## Code

I used `astropy`. I was thinking of using `CSPICE` and `spiceypy` but they felt overkill. For a given epoch and Earth position, I compute the Moon's position (returned by `astropy.coordinates.get_moon`) and transform it local `AltAz` coordinates.

Then, I plot the `AltAz` scatter plot.

Find the code here: [github](https://github.com/shiningsurya/visualize-astrometry).

## 1d50m29s

At first, I didn't get any analemma pattern using a time step of one day. I thought I had to use sidereal day. But, that APOD enlightened me to use a time step of `1 day 50 minutes 29 seconds` and lo, it works like magic.

I don't know why this specific time difference works. I would love to find out. But, maybe next time.

## Example 

It would totally depend on the time and position but as an example:

### Single position

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/analemma_moon_single.png">

### Multiple position

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/img/analemma_moon_multiple.png">

## So, result?

So, what I saw on reddit and in my newsfeed is indeed fake, or maybe their timestep was only a day. In any case, that's no analemma.
