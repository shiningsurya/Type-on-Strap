To get any point across more than likely no matter how strong the individual reasonings are, present three reasons.
Also have the strongest reason as your second reason.


1. First reason gets listener's attention. 
2. Second presents reasoning.
3. Third shows tenacity/preparedness.


Fourth and beyond start overwhelming all the parties. So best to avoid.


### Remarks

A quick google led me to _Power of Three_.

Kind of like we remember three things very vividly.
