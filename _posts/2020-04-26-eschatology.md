title: Eschatology, the reset switch?

_I hope this post will be a part of a series of posts on religions._


One thing which is seeming common among _almost_ all the religions is the notion of eschatology.


A word I didn't know until I googled and came across these Wikipedia articles:


> [Eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology) 


> [Apocalypticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypticism) 


_Almost_ all religions seem to have this idea of **end of times** or **end of humankind**.


Wikipedia does a better job of summarising what every religion predicts, so Imma skip it out.


_Almost_ all the religions also talk about the subsequent beginning of a new era. A new era in which everything is good and peaceful.
It is kind of like a _reset_ switch.


Some religions seem to say that current time is in the final epochs where disagreeable (_bad things_) things are rampant.

| Religion    |  Name of the current epoch    |  Characteristics    | Final [Y/N] | 
|-------------|-----------------------------  |---------------------|-------------|
| Hinduism    | Kali Yuga   | maximum adharmam                      | Y           |
| Jainism     | _avsarpini-Duhsama_ | Extreme sorrow and misery     | Y           |

Other religions either don't have a notion of epochs or I missed it.

### Almost

I added almost because I am not too sure if wikipedia covers all the religions. I don't know how many religions we have on this Earth.
